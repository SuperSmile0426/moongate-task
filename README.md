# moongate-task

Hello. This is Nakao Akira.
I completed the coding test for task1 and task2 using the React, Next.js and tailwind-css.
Of course, I can add the all test case like unit test, e2e test and so on using several node_modules like jest, cypress, etc. But this is simple test so I think it doesn't need the test case.
If you want, I will implemet the simple test.

And in task1 we are using the eager loading method. But for the user experience, we can use the other loading metheods and SSR(server-side rendering).
Please check and if there is any issues let me knoww.
Thank you.


Plus: Coding test took almost 1:30min. If general requirements was implemented in a hour. Because of some beautiful style, it took some more time. Hope your understanding.
